Here's a brief explanation of each folder and file:

- `my-flask-app/`: This is the root directory of your Flask project.

- `app/`: This is where you'll store your Flask application code.
  - `__init__.py`: This file initializes the Flask application.
  - `routes.py`: This is where you define your routes and view functions.
  - `models.py` (optional): If you're using a database, you can define your database models in this file.
  - `templates/`: This folder is for storing your HTML templates.
  - `static/`: This folder is for storing your static assets like CSS, JavaScript, and images.

- `config.py`: This file can contain configuration settings for your application.

- `venv/`: This is a virtual environment where you can install and manage your project's dependencies separately.

- `requirements.txt`: This file lists the Python packages and their versions required for your project. You can generate it using `pip freeze > requirements.txt`.

- `run.py`: This is the entry point for running your Flask application. You can start your app by running `python run.py`.
