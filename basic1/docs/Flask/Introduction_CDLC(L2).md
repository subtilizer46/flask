# Differences between Django and Flask

## Django:

**1. Full-Featured:**
Django is a high-level, full-stack framework that comes with many built-in features and conventions.

**2. Opinionated:** 
It follows the "batteries-included" philosophy, providing a structured way to build web applications.

**3. Complexity:** 
Django can be complex for beginners due to its comprehensive nature.

**4. Built-in Components:** 
It includes features like an ORM, authentication, and an admin panel out of the box.

**5. Rapid Development:** 
Django can speed up development by providing pre-built tools and patterns.

**6. Suitable for Complex Apps:** 
Ideal for larger, more complex web applications with many features.

**7. Convention Over Configuration:** 
Django enforces certain conventions, which can be restrictive for some developers.

**8. Learning Curve:** 
It may have a steeper learning curve, but it provides a clear structure for projects.

## Flask:

**1. Micro Framework:** 
Flask is a minimalistic, micro-framework that provides the essentials for web development.

**2. Flexible:** 
It offers more flexibility and allows developers to choose their tools and libraries.

**3. Simplicity:** 
Flask is straightforward and approachable, making it easier for beginners.

**4. Minimal Built-in Features:** 
It doesn't include as many built-in features as Django, requiring developers to make more 
choices.

**5. Customizable:** 
Ideal for projects where you need a high degree of customization and control.

**6. Lightweight:** 
Flask is lightweight and suitable for smaller to medium-sized projects.

**7. No Strict Conventions:** 
It doesn't enforce strict conventions, allowing developers to structure projects as they see fit.

**8. Learning Curve:** 
Flask has a gentler learning curve, making it a good choice for those new to web development.
